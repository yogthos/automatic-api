# Contributing

Your contributions are welcome! Please submit a pull request or create an issue to add a new project to the list or to update an existing one.

Note that `README.md` is automatically generated from `README.md.template` and the data in [`data/`](./data/). Do not edit `README.md` directly. To update a project's information, edit the corresponding file in `data/`. To add a project, create a new file.

## What projects to submit

To qualify as "automatic" for our purposes, a piece of software must be a server that requires a small amount of configuration to set up, not a Web framework for building APIs, a code generator, or a boilerplate. It should reflect changes to the database schema, if any, without user intervention. A submitted project must be at least alpha quality, i.e., ready for users to test. A project that is no longer actively maintained must be more mature than that and already tested by users.
